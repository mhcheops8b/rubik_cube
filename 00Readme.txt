cubeNNN.h - template class for NxNxN Rubik's cube. 

  It is a base for libraries:
	 _cube222.o (_cube222.h, _cube222.cpp), 
	 _cube333.o (_cube333.h, _cube333.cpp), 
	 _cube444.o (_cube444.h, _cube444.cpp), 
	 _cube555.o (_cube555.h, _cube555.cpp), 
	 _cube666.o (_cube666.h, _cube666.cpp). 
  Moves were generated by gen_cube_perm (gen_cube_perm.cpp) utility.

  Particular components of NxNxN rubik's cube
  (cube444_comp.cpp is an implementation of 4x4x4 cube from its 
   components - corners, coupled_edges and center_corners.)

center_edges_old.h
  - Old implementation of Center_edges - Center_edges_odd<N> and 
    Center_edges_even<N> classes (it requires c++14 standard to compile.)

  - Visual Studio Community 2017 solution and projects.

Test programs:

gen_cube_perm.cpp
  - Generates moves (permutations 0-based (0..6*N*N - 1)) for NxNxN cube 
    (gen_cube_moves<N>() method)

test_cube666_solve.cpp
  - Solution (sequence of moves) of the selected randomly scrambled 6x6x6 cube

test_cube666_moves.cpp
  - Some special algorithms tested on 6x6x6 cube (with displayed moves)

test_cube666_shuffle.cpp
  - Shuffles 6x6x6 cube (printed permutation is 1-based (1..6*N*N)!)

cube444_comp.cpp
  - The implementation of 4x4x4 cube from its 
    components - corners, coupled_edges and center_corners.
